### Golden Rule

Use common sense and be consistent. If your are extending, enhancing, or bug
fixing existing source code, use the style that is already being used.
This allows the source code to stay uniform and easy to follow. The point of
having coding guidelines is to have a common base for writing code. It should
help to provide a uniform code base across a project or organization/company
and help other developer to understand the code base more efficiently.
